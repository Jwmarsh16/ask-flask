# .github/workflows/ci.yml
# Purpose: Build client, lint & test backend with coverage on every push/PR.
# Changes from previous version:
# - Adds ruff/black/isort checks (Python)
# - Adds pytest with coverage for backend
# - Keeps Vite build to ensure FE compiles; FE tests will be wired once you share package.json
